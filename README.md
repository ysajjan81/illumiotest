Download code:
Use the link to clone the project and use the command "git clone https://github.com/ysajjan81/illumiotest.git"

Open the project in IDE (eclipse, vscode etc)
Run the java Application. 

For the implementation I use Hashing for network rules. The time complexity to check the value is O(1). 
And space complexity is is O(n).

I used Junit5 for testing purpose and created test cases to chekc the edge cases.
